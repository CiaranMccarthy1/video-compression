Video Delta Compressor

A lightweight C++ tool for compressing MP4 videos by storing only significant pixel changes between frames. Instead of saving entire frames, this compressor calculates per-pixel deltas and outputs a custom .ige file format, drastically reducing file size for videos with minor frame-to-frame changes.
